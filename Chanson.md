**Behind Blue Eyes**

```No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes

No one knows what it's like
To be hated
To be fated
To telling only lies

But my dreams
They aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be

I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free

No one knows what it's like
To feel these feelings
Like I do
And I blame you

No one bites back as hard
On their anger
None of my pain and woe
Can show through

But my dreams
They aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be

I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free

Discover... L-I-M-P
say it... discover

No one knows what it's like
To be mistreated
To be defeated
behind blue eyes

and no one knows how to say that theyre sorry
and dont worry
I'm not telling lies

but my dreams
they arent as empty
as my conscience seems to be

I have hours, only lonely
my love is vengence
that's never free

No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes```
